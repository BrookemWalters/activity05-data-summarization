Activity 5 - Data Summarization
================

It is assumed that you have read Sections 5.5 - 5.6 from R4DS and
completed the Derive Information with dplyr Primer.

In this activity, you will:

-   Produce numerical summaries of variables using `{dplyr}`.
-   Produce numerical summaries of variables by a grouping variable
    using `{dplyr}`.
-   Compute new variables in a dataset using `{dplyr}`.

## ☑️ Task 1: The Workflow

Remember that more detailed directions can be found in [Task 1 of
Activity
4](https://github.com/gvsu-sta518/activity04-data-pipelines#%EF%B8%8F-task-1-the-workflow).

![fork](README-img/fork-icon.png) **Fork** this repo and clone it to a
new [RStudio Project](https://rstudio.gvsu.edu/)

<b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you have any questions, contact your
instructor or another group. We will complete this Activity during our
next class session

## ☑️ Task 2: Complete the RMarkdown File

The `activity05-data-summarization.Rmd` file contains the directions for
this activity. For the rest of this class period, you will complete the
RMarkdown document with your neighbor(s). Your instructor will be
circling and be available to help when needed.

Note that each person is working in their own repo. We are not worrying
about collaborating for the time being and instead will be working on
being more comfortable with the workflow for working between RStudio and
GitHub.

However, do not continue in this README document until you and your
neighbor(s) have completed your `.Rmd` files.

## ☑️ Task 3: Reflection

We now have a number of skills to help us explore datasets. Before we
add too many more tools/skills, we should verify what we have currently
learned. Look at the [Course
Objectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CTL6DJYZfn2aqE1PQqJ84yiaY6XBbb_Sz7momwuL_8/edit?usp=sharing)
that we came up with at the beginning of this semester. Take 5 minutes
to identify which of these you feel comfortable with. How could you
demonstrate what you have learned?

Now, think back through the 5 Activities that we have completed. What is
still not clear? What will you do to better understand these tricky
items?

**Next**: Activity 6 will focus on restructuring data to be easier for
humans to read or easier for computers to handle.
